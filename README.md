# Brain-Tumor-Detection-System
'Brain Tumor Detection System' â€“  accurate diagnosis from medical images. Our system revolutionizes the detection process, saving valuable time and expertise. Boasting an impressive 97.17% accuracy rate, our model excels at pinpointing tumor regions, minimizing the risk of false results.

+ user-friendly interface, featuring just two pages: one for uploading images and the other for viewing results. Backed by AI technology to give a simple advice if result shown as positive.





# Detailed Project Description:
Utilizing a combination of traditional machine learning methods and advanced deep learning models (Nural Networks), our system ensures accuracy and reliability in diagnosis. We've trained our machine learning algorithms with a publicly available dataset sourced from Kaggle, ensuring robust performance.

Upon analysis, our system provides clear results, accompanied by simple advice. Powered by the ChatGPT API, our advice feature adds an extra layer of insight to guide users through their next steps.


# Detailed Outline:
1) Using good enviroment for data so it will be entered to introduce exploratory data analysis (EDA).
2) Data preprocessing, comparison of traditional machine learning and deep learning models.
3) Focus on convolutional neural networks by using Python to choose the most optimal machine learning model.
4) A design of the interface should introduce the user to a web page that asks the user to input a medical image of the brain.
5) It should perform with the data I have evaluated to give an output of the brain tumor detection on another web page with an advice regarding the result that is provided by ChatGPT using ChatGPT API that will be connected to my program.
