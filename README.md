# Brain-Tumor-Detection-System
This project aids doctors in diagnosing whether a patient has a brain tumor and identifying its stage. 


Detailed Project Description
This project should present a view of the brain and its condition regarding tumors. A medical image will be uploaded to a web page, and it should output the brain tumor classifications, whether the brain has tumors or not, this will be performed by using traditional machine learning methods and deep learning models, and depending on the result, a simple advice will be shown to the user by using ChatGPT API. Machine learning will be trained through a provided publicly available dataset through Kaggle [1].

Detailed Outline
Using Google Colab data will be entered to introduce exploratory data analysis (EDA), Data preprocessing, comparison of traditional machine learning and deep learning models, and focus on convolutional neural networks by using Python to choose the most optimal machine learning model. The design of the interface should introduce the user to a web page that asks the user to input a medical image of the brain. It should perform with the data I have evaluated to give an output of the brain tumor detection on another page with advice regarding the result that is provided by ChatGPT using ChatGPT API that will be connected to my program.
